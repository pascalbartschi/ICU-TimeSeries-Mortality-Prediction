# ICU Mortality Time-Series Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict ICU patient mortality using time-series data from the [PhysioNet 2012 Challenge](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2012/1.0.0/) dataset. The dataset consists of 37 physiological variables recorded over 48 hours, along with static patient information. The objective is to develop machine learning models to assist clinical decision-making.

## Methodology
- **Data Processing**: Handling missing values, feature extraction, and normalization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- **Deep Learning**: LSTMs, Transformers, and Bidirectional models.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Contrastive learning and representation learning.
- **Foundation Models**: LLMs and Chronos time-series models.

## Performance Evaluation
- **Classification Metrics**: AuROC, AuPRC.
- **Representation Learning**: t-SNE/UMAP visualization, clustering metrics.

## Usage
- Preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
- Implemented models include classical ML, deep learning, and foundation models.
