# ICU Mortality Time-Series Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict ICU patient mortality using time-series data from the [PhysioNet 2012 Challenge](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2012/1.0.0/) dataset. The dataset consists of 37 physiological variables recorded over 48 hours, along with static patient information. The objective is to develop machine learning models to assist clinical decision-making.

## How to run this code to get all results from A-Z

1. Use the environment configured on the student-cluster
2. Run 01-data-processing-exploration.ipynb to do the preprocessing and get the parquet file in the right place
